# cherryplus-redesign

Simple, beginner-friendly redesign of Cherry+ Network landing & team pages.

## What this is
- Two static pages: `index.html` (landing) and `team.html` (team).
- Styles in `style.css`, small interactions in `script.js`.
- Designed for a clean Gen-Z-friendly red + black look.

## How to run (no installs)
1. Click **Code → Download ZIP** on GitHub.
2. Extract the ZIP.
3. Double-click `index.html` to open in your browser.
4. Open `team.html` to view the team page.

## How to preview mobile (Chrome)
- Open the page in Chrome, press **F12** → click the phone icon (Toggle device toolbar).
- Choose a device, refresh, then take screenshot.

## Screenshots to add (suggested names)
- `screenshots/landing-desktop.png`
- `screenshots/landing-mobile.png`
- `screenshots/team-desktop.png`
- `screenshots/team-mobile.png`

## What to submit
- Public repo link (this repository) on the Cherry+ recruitment portal.
- Make sure the screenshots are uploaded inside the `screenshots/` folder.

## Notes
- You can edit names and roles on `team.html` (inside the team cards).
- If something looks off, try refreshing the browser cache (Ctrl+F5).
